"""

Purpose: This file is to experiment with cropping pages of a pdf because 
in most cases, we are not going to want to extract data from an entire 
page, but rather, from one portion of the page (e.g. a table on the page). 

To accomplish this, we will be experimenting with the cropBox function 
of PyPDF2.
