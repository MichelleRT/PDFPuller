The purpose of this program is to extract data from a pdf file without 
the need to convert the pdf file to a text file beforehand, therefore
saving time. We will be using the Python PyPDF2 module to accomplish
this task. 

Installation: 

pip install PyPDF2

If there is some authentication and/or proxy error, try:

sudo -E pip install PyPDF2
